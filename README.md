# NBT Utilman

**NBT Utilman** is a lightweight Windows utility script that centralizes common actions into a simple launcher. It is meant to be run locally on a Windows machine and provides a quick, reliable entry point for day‑to‑day tasks.

## What It Is
- A single PowerShell script that drives the app UI and behavior.
- A WPF layout file that defines the interface.
- This `.github-info` folder, which stores GitHub‑related metadata for the project.

## Usage (Local)
1. Open PowerShell.
2. Run the script at the path above.
3. The script loads the WPF layout and presents the UI.

## Notes
This repository is primarily for tracking the utility and its metadata.
